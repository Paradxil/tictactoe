**Tech Startup Coding Challenge: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Showdown**

Welcome to our exciting tech startup coding challenge, the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Showdown! This is an opportunity not only to prove your prowess in coding, but also to have some fun while showcasing your skills.

In this challenge, you will be building a Tic Tac Toe simulator that pits user versus computer in an epic battle of wits.

**The Challenge**

Your task is to create a Tic Tac Toe game in the language of your choice where users can play against an AI opponent. The game should incorporate object-oriented design principles, showcase efficient use of algorithms, and highlight the clarity of your code. The simulator should have robust documentation and unit tests.

**Requirements**

The simulator you design must include the following features:

1. **Tic Tac Toe Board:** The game interface should display a standard 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell should be identifiable for input, with either X, O or empty.
2. **Player Interaction:** The simulator should prompt the user to enter their move in a user-friendly way. This could be via text input, mouse click, or any other innovative method you choose.
3. **Game Progression:** After each move, the board should update to reflect the new state of the game. It should be clear whose turn it is and which spots on the board are still available.
4. **AI Opponent:** The game should include a computer opponent. The AI does not need to follow complex strategies or use true AI techiques, but it should make valid moves. Extra points for an opponent that is more intelligent.
5. **Determining a Winner:** The game should correctly recognize the end state of the game and declare a winner, a loss, or a tie, as appropriate.
6. **Code Quality:** We highly value clean, efficient, and readable code. Your code should demonstrate clear object-oriented design, good algorithm usage, and proper error handling.
7. **Documentation:** Each class and method should have clear documentation describing its purpose and functionality.
8. **Testing:** Write unit tests to prove that your components work as expected, individually and collectively. This includes but is not limited to, verifying proper user input, correct move execution, accurate game state progression, and reliable win condition detection.

This is not only a chance to exhibit your coding capabilities but also an opportunity to unleash your creativity. So, go ahead, and may the best algorithm win!

Note: Your solution will be evaluated by Advocate's CTO offline after your submission.
